# SteamDB Plugin for Millennium

This plugin ports the functionality of the popular [SteamDB Browser Extension](https://github.com/SteamDatabase/BrowserExtension) to the Steam client using Millennium.

## Features
>Pretty much all of the SteamDB extension's features are included in this plugin.
  
See the [SteamDB Browser Extension](https://github.com/SteamDatabase/BrowserExtension) for more details about each feature or SteamDB's [extension page](https://steamdb.info/extension/).

## Installation

1. Ensure you have at least version 2.16.0 of [Millennium](https://github.com/shdwmtr/millennium) installed on your Steam client
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/tddebart/Steam-SteamDB-addon/releases) of this plugin
3. Place the plugin files in your Millennium plugins directory (should be a plugins folder in your Steam client directory)
4. Restart your Steam client
5. Enable the SteamDB plugin in the Millennium plugin menu

## Usage

Once installed it should just work out of the box.

Make sure the the plugin folder is called exactly "SteamDB-plugin". Otherwise things like the styling or options page will break.

To see if the plugin is working you can go to any store app page and look for these icons

## Configuration

To configure the plugin:

1. Open Steam and navigate to the main store page
2. Click on "Your Store" in the top menu, then select "Preferences"
3. Look for the "SteamDB Options" button and click it

Alternatively, you can access the options page directly by entering this URL in your Steam client:
https://store.steampowered.com/account/?steamdb=true

Here you can customize various features and behaviors of the SteamDB plugin to suit your preferences. Just like in the SteamDB extension.
